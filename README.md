This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

I was inspired by a previous student's project, "Eat The Candy", featuring a dynamic color-changing background. The creative use of animations sparked the idea to implement a similar concept in my own project, by adding a striped and diagonally moving red white and blue background reflecting the political theme. You can view this awesome project which inspired me at https://scso-ucsc.github.io/Incremental-Game-Development/ !

I was also inspired by the "Caffeine Clicker" project by a previous student that, when clicking on the coffee emoji to get your counter up, the emoji does a fun little rotation. I wanted to do something similar, so I decided that, when a player purchases an upgrade, the emoji corresponding to that upgrade pops up from the upgrade button and then quickly fades.
